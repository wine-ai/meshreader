```python
def main():
    meshdata = Meshdata(os.path.join("meshdata", "54381188"))
    
    # bbox (list)
    bbox = meshdata.get_bbox()
    print(bbox)
    
    # Time-series daily precipitation (list)
    precipitation = meshdata.get_precipitation()
    print(precipitation)
    
    # Time-series daily sunlight duration (list)
    daylight_hours = meshdata.get_daylight_hours()
    print(daylight_hours)
    
    # Time-series daily accumulated solar radiation (list)
    solar_radiation = meshdata.get_solar_radiation()
    print(solar_radiation)
    
    # Time-series daily average temperature (list)
    average_temperature = meshdata.get_average_temperature()
    print(average_temperature)
    
    # Time-series daily lowest temperature (list)
    lowest_temperature = meshdata.get_lowest_temperature()
    print(lowest_temperature)
    
    # Time-series daily highest temperature (list)
    maximum_temperature = meshdata.get_maximum_temperature()
    print(maximum_temperature)
    
    # Land use area (dict)
    landuse = meshdata.get_landuse()
    print(landuse)
    
    # Elevation distribution (list)
    elevation = meshdata.get_elevation()
    print(elevation)
    
    # Slope distribution (list)
    slope = meshdata.get_slope()
    print(slope)
    
    # Slope orientation distribution (list)
    direction = meshdata.get_direction()
    print(direction)
    
    # Geological pixel value distribution (list)
    geology = meshdata.get_geology()
    print(geology)
    
```

## Execution Method

- This program is a Python class, so it is intended to be called from a Python program, but its operation can also be confirmed with the following command:

```shell
cd meshreader
python __main__.py
```

## About `mesh_stats.py`
In summary, `mesh_stats.py` is designed to perform data analysis and statistics calculations on grid square based geographic data. It handles various types of environmental data, computes statistical measures, and organizes the results into a structured file. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. **Importing Libraries**: It imports several libraries like `os`, `sys`, `math`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `PIL.Image`, `scipy.stats`, and `collections.Counter` for various operations like file handling, mathematical calculations, data manipulation, and statistical analysis.

2. **Meshdata Class**: This class is responsible for reading and processing Grid Square data. It has methods for:
    - Initializing an instance with a directory and Grid Square code.
    - Retrieving bounding box, precipitation, daylight hours, solar radiation, average temperature, lowest temperature, and highest temperature data as lists.
    - Extracting land use data as a dictionary.
    - Reading and decoding elevation, slope, and direction distributions from image files into lists.
    - Converting RGB values from images into real values (`decode_datapng` method).
    - Reading and processing geological data from an image into a list.
    - Calculating monthly averages for various environmental parameters.

3. **Utility Functions**: 
    - `calculate_mean_bearing`: Computes the average direction from a list of bearings.
    - `calculate_statistics`: Calculates statistical measures like mean, standard deviation, median, and mode for the given data.
    - `save_statistics_to_tsv`: Saves the calculated statistics to a TSV (Tab-Separated Values) file, including statistics for temperature, precipitation, daylight, solar radiation, elevation, slope, direction, and geological data counts for each Grid Square.

4. **Main Functionality**:
    - The `main` function orchestrates reading Grid Square data, computing statistics for each Grid Square code, and saving these statistics to a TSV file.
    - It processes data for each Grid Square code in the specified directory using methods from the Grid Square Data class and accumulates statistics and geological counts.
    - Finally, it outputs the results to a TSV file using `save_statistics_to_tsv`.

5. **Command-Line Interface**: The script is designed to be executed from the command line. It requires two arguments: the base directory of the Grid Square data and the output directory for the TSV file.

### Usage of `mesh_stats.py`

To run the "mesh_stats.py" script, it's assumed to be executed via the command line interface and requires two arguments: the base directory where the Grid Square data is stored, and the output directory where the statistical results will be saved. Usage to execute the script is below:

   ```
   python mesh_stats.py [base_dir] [output_base_dir]
   ```
   Here, `[base_dir]` represents the path to the base directory containing the Grid Square data, and `[output_base_dir]` represents the path to the output directory where you want to save the results in a TSV file.

For example, if your Grid Square data is in the `/meshdata` directory and you want to save the results in the `/meshstats` directory, you would execute the command like this:
```
python mesh_stats.py /meshdata /meshstats
```
This command will load the Grid Square data from the specified directory, calculate statistics for each Grid Square, and ultimately save those results as a TSV file in the specified output directory.
